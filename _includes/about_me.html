          I have over 2 years of experience as a software engineer, and have worked
          mainly on AngularJS and Angular 2 framework. While I'm a proficient front-end
          developer, my expertise is in building web application.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love building things.
          While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle,
          I'm most attracted to solving real customer problems with a business justification.
          I'm looking for a developer contributor role where I can take on on collaborative
          team player responsibilites, and gain experience with
          frameworks and industry knowledge.
